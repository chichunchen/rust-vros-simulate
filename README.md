# vros-simulate
Simulator build for research of virtual reality optimization.


## Usage
First of all, you need a recent version of rust compiler (maybe >= 1.25).

```
cargo run user_viewport_result/Paris-sJxiPiAaB4k tracedump/paris.txt object_as_cluster/paris.json 0.96 20 1600 1600 2000 2000
```

## Result
The data is visualized in the [vros-dataset](https://github.com/horizon-research/vros-dataset).
And you might be interested in the [summary](https://github.com/horizon-research/vros-dataset/blob/master/heatmap.ipynb) of the data.
